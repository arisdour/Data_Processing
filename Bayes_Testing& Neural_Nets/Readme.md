**** Problem 1 ****

Implement the Bayes Hypothesis test for 10^6  randomly generated data that follow two different Normal Distributions N (0, 1) and 0.5* N (1,1) + 0.5* N(-1,1).

Use 200 randomly generated 2D Vectors from the first problem in order to train a Neural Network  with 2 hidden layers 
of 20 neurons and 1 exit. Train the neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent.



**** Problem 2 ****

The two files contain two different neural networks trained on the MNIST dataset. 
The neural networks are trained using Hinge method or Cross entropy.
