*** Problem 1a *** 

Use the K-Means algorithm to classify the 200 2-D Vectors of the hw3-1data.mat file.

*** Problem 1b *** 

In order to get better accuracy , add a third dimension (Z) two the data A(X,Y). 
The third dimension is the  distance between each point ant the point (0, 0).

*** Problem 2a *** 

Use the expectation maximization method in order to classify the data and calculate the accuracy.
