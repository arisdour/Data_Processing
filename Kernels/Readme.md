*** Problem 1 *** 

Compare the Laplacian Kernel and the Gaussian Kernel by approaching the probability density
function of 1000 randomly generated 2-D Vectors that are uniformly distributed in [0,1].


*** Problem 2 *** 

Create a classifier that uses a kernel method to correctly label 2-D
data from  hw2-2data.mat as 'star' (1) or 'circle' (-1).
